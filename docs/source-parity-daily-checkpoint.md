# Daily source parity checkpoint

This file records the resumable checkpoint for the automated migration of committed
changes from the read-only `R:\maliev-web` source into `Legacy.Maliev.*` repositories.
It does not authorize source edits, pushes, deployments, database writes, GKE changes,
or Google configuration publication.

## Current boundary

- Proven historical Legacy Web checkpoint: `48e628cf7803264bd0b09bfa7a55b15b47e192dd`.
- Source branch inspected: `main`.
- Source head inspected on 2026-08-29: `54ad353a386dc9476f779f9b3fdf152b93b135c9`.
- Committed source changes after the historical checkpoint: 123.
- Daily automation: `daily-legacy-maliev-migration-parity`, scheduled for 08:00 Asia/Bangkok.
- Uncommitted source files are deliberately excluded from parity accounting.

## Migrated commits after the historical checkpoint

| Source commit | Source outcome | Legacy repository | Legacy commit | Validation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `25db5545b0f5f575f61616af2ba54ee45e656a20` | Make custom manufacturing the canonical owner for process-unknown search intent across the custom, CNC, 3D-printing, and 3D-scanning routes | `Legacy.Maliev.Web` | `b363dd6` | Release build: 0 warnings/errors; focused SEO and structured-data suite: 28/28; affected service-route suite: 75/75; format clean |
| `bf4c550cb28fd0432d9c178a7072d07d61e43e13` | Ignore HTML-looking strings in ordinary JavaScript when verifying rendered production SEO documents | `Legacy.Maliev.Web` | `41e4e0f` | Production verifier baseline restored for the extracted repository; PowerShell syntax clean; Pester production SEO contracts: 32/32 |
| `656ee29576839f16c9af8422283f321cdfe612cb` | Reject invalid language-switch cultures without losing the canonical English/Thai URL contract | `Legacy.Maliev.Web` | `8ccb942` | Release build: 0 warnings/errors; focused localization, navigation, and canonical suite: 29/29; format clean |

## Supporting migration maintenance

| Legacy commit | Outcome | Validation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `65be64c` | Pin patched `SSH.NET` 2026.0.0 over the vulnerable Testcontainers transitive version | Restore succeeded; NuGet vulnerable-package audit reports none; Release build: 0 warnings/errors |

## Remaining gate

The other 120 committed source changes after `48e628c` remain pending commit-by-commit
classification and migration. They include public Web SEO, structured data, responsive
assets and layouts, consent-gated analytics and Ads measurement, quotation lifecycle,
authentication/profile behavior, service tracing and logging, pricing, operational
configuration, and changes owned by non-Web `Legacy.Maliev.*` services.

The complete Legacy Web test suite currently has an independent resource defect: the
test host exceeded 13 GB working set without producing a result. The affected 29-test
boundary suite passes. The complete-suite resource issue must be isolated before this
checkpoint can be promoted from focused validation to full-suite validation.
